      CHAPTER XVI.<br></br>OF PERSONS, AUTHORS, AND THINGS PERSONATED
    </h2>
<p>
      A Person What
    </p>
<p>
      A PERSON, is he “whose words or actions are considered, either as his own,
      or as representing the words or actions of an other man, or of any other
      thing to whom they are attributed, whether Truly or by Fiction.”
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0179"></a>
      Person Naturall, And Artificiall
    </h3>
<p>
      When they are considered as his owne, then is he called a Naturall Person:
      And when they are considered as representing the words and actions of an
      other, then is he a Feigned or Artificiall person.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0180"></a>
      The Word Person, Whence
    </h3>
<p>
      The word Person is latine: instead whereof the Greeks have Prosopon, which
      signifies the Face, as Persona in latine signifies the Disguise, or
      Outward Appearance of a man, counterfeited on the Stage; and somtimes more
      particularly that part of it, which disguiseth the face, as a Mask or
      Visard: And from the Stage, hath been translated to any Representer of
      speech and action, as well in Tribunalls, as Theaters. So that a Person,
      is the same that an Actor is, both on the Stage and in common
      Conversation; and to Personate, is to Act, or Represent himselfe, or an
      other; and he that acteth another, is said to beare his Person, or act in
      his name; (in which sence Cicero useth it where he saies, “Unus Sustineo
      Tres Personas; Mei, Adversarii, &amp; Judicis, I beare three Persons; my
      own, my Adversaries, and the Judges;”) and is called in diverse occasions,
      diversly; as a Representer, or Representative, a Lieutenant, a Vicar, an
      Attorney, a Deputy, a Procurator, an Actor, and the like.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0181"></a>
      Actor, Author; Authority
    </h3>
<p>
      Of Persons Artificiall, some have their words and actions Owned by those
      whom they represent. And then the Person is the Actor; and he that owneth
      his words and actions, is the AUTHOR: In which case the Actor acteth by
      Authority. For that which in speaking of goods and possessions, is called
      an Owner, and in latine Dominus, in Greeke Kurios; speaking of Actions, is
      called Author. And as the Right of possession, is called Dominion; so the
      Right of doing any Action, is called AUTHORITY. So that by Authority, is
      alwayes understood a Right of doing any act: and Done By Authority, done
      by Commission, or Licence from him whose right it is.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0182"></a>
      Covenants By Authority, Bind The Author
    </h3>
<p>
      From hence it followeth, that when the Actor maketh a Covenant by
      Authority, he bindeth thereby the Author, no lesse than if he had made it
      himselfe; and no lesse subjecteth him to all the consequences of the same.
      And therfore all that hath been said formerly, (Chap. 14) of the nature of
      Covenants between man and man in their naturall capacity, is true also
      when they are made by their Actors, Representers, or Procurators, that
      have authority from them, so far-forth as is in their Commission, but no
      farther.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore he that maketh a Covenant with the Actor, or Representer,
      not knowing the Authority he hath, doth it at his own perill. For no man
      is obliged by a Covenant, whereof he is not Author; nor consequently by a
      Covenant made against, or beside the Authority he gave.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0183"></a>
      But Not The Actor
    </h3>
<p>
      When the Actor doth any thing against the Law of Nature by command of the
      Author, if he be obliged by former Covenant to obey him, not he, but the
      Author breaketh the Law of Nature: for though the Action be against the
      Law of Nature; yet it is not his: but contrarily; to refuse to do it, is
      against the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth breach of Covenant.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0184"></a>
      The Authority Is To Be Shewne
    </h3>
<p>
      And he that maketh a Covenant with the Author, by mediation of the Actor,
      not knowing what Authority he hath, but onely takes his word; in case such
      Authority be not made manifest unto him upon demand, is no longer obliged:
      For the Covenant made with the Author, is not valid, without his
      Counter-assurance. But if he that so Covenanteth, knew before hand he was
      to expect no other assurance, than the Actors word; then is the Covenant
      valid; because the Actor in this case maketh himselfe the Author. And
      therefore, as when the Authority is evident, the Covenant obligeth the
      Author, not the Actor; so when the Authority is feigned, it obligeth the
      Actor onely; there being no Author but himselfe.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0185"></a>
      Things Personated, Inanimate
    </h3>
<p>
      There are few things, that are uncapable of being represented by Fiction.
      Inanimate things, as a Church, an Hospital, a Bridge, may be Personated by
      a Rector, Master, or Overseer. But things Inanimate, cannot be Authors,
      nor therefore give Authority to their Actors: Yet the Actors may have
      Authority to procure their maintenance, given them by those that are
      Owners, or Governours of those things. And therefore, such things cannot
      be Personated, before there be some state of Civill Government.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0186"></a>
      Irrational
    </h3>
<p>
      Likewise Children, Fooles, and Mad-men that have no use of Reason, may be
      Personated by Guardians, or Curators; but can be no Authors (during that
      time) of any action done by them, longer then (when they shall recover the
      use of Reason) they shall judge the same reasonable. Yet during the Folly,
      he that hath right of governing them, may give Authority to the Guardian.
      But this again has no place but in a State Civill, because before such
      estate, there is no Dominion of Persons.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0187"></a>
      False Gods
    </h3>
<p>
      An Idol, or meer Figment of the brain, may be Personated; as were the Gods
      of the Heathen; which by such Officers as the State appointed, were
      Personated, and held Possessions, and other Goods, and Rights, which men
      from time to time dedicated, and consecrated unto them. But idols cannot
      be Authors: for a Idol is nothing. The Authority proceeded from the State:
      and therefore before introduction of Civill Government, the Gods of the
      Heathen could not be Personated.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0188"></a>
      The True God
    </h3>
<p>
      The true God may be Personated. As he was; first, by Moses; who governed
      the Israelites, (that were not his, but Gods people,) not in his own name,
      with Hoc Dicit Moses; but in Gods Name, with Hoc Dicit Dominus. Secondly,
      by the son of man, his own Son our Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, that came
      to reduce the Jewes, and induce all Nations into the Kingdome of his
      Father; not as of himselfe, but as sent from his Father. And thirdly, by
      the Holy Ghost, or Comforter, speaking, and working in the Apostles: which
      Holy Ghost, was a Comforter that came not of himselfe; but was sent, and
      proceeded from them both.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0189"></a>
      A Multitude Of Men, How One Person
    </h3>
<p>
      A Multitude of men, are made One Person, when they are by one man, or one
      Person, Represented; so that it be done with the consent of every one of
      that Multitude in particular. For it is the Unity of the Representer, not
      the Unity of the Represented, that maketh the Person One. And it is the
      Representer that beareth the Person, and but one Person: And Unity, cannot
      otherwise be understood in Multitude.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0190"></a>
      Every One Is Author
    </h3>
<p>
      And because the Multitude naturally is not One, but Many; they cannot be
      understood for one; but many Authors, of every thing their Representative
      faith, or doth in their name; Every man giving their common Representer,
      Authority from himselfe in particular; and owning all the actions the
      Representer doth, in case they give him Authority without stint:
      Otherwise, when they limit him in what, and how farre he shall represent
      them, none of them owneth more, than they gave him commission to Act.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0191"></a>
      An Actor May Be Many Men Made One By Plurality Of Voyces
    </h3>
<p>
      And if the Representative consist of many men, the voyce of the greater
      number, must be considered as the voyce of them all. For if the lesser
      number pronounce (for example) in the Affirmative, and the greater in the
      Negative, there will be Negatives more than enough to destroy the
      Affirmatives; and thereby the excesse of Negatives, standing
      uncontradicted, are the onely voyce the Representative hath.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0192"></a>
      Representatives, When The Number Is Even, Unprofitable
    </h3>
<p>
      And a Representative of even number, especially when the number is not
      great, whereby the contradictory voyces are oftentimes equall, is
      therefore oftentimes mute, and uncapable of Action. Yet in some cases
      contradictory voyces equall in number, may determine a question; as in
      condemning, or absolving, equality of votes, even in that they condemne
      not, do absolve; but not on the contrary condemne, in that they absolve
      not. For when a Cause is heard; not to condemne, is to absolve; but on the
      contrary, to say that not absolving, is condemning, is not true. The like
      it is in a deliberation of executing presently, or deferring till another
      time; For when the voyces are equall, the not decreeing Execution, is a
      decree of Dilation.
    </p>
<h3><a id="link2H_4_0193"></a>
      Negative Voyce
    </h3>
<p>
      Or if the number be odde, as three, or more, (men, or assemblies;) whereof
      every one has by a Negative Voice, authority to take away the effect of
      all the Affirmative Voices of the rest, This number is no Representative;
      because by the diversity of Opinions, and Interests of men, it becomes
      oftentimes, and in cases of the greatest consequence, a mute Person, and
      unapt, as for may things else, so for the government of a Multitude,
      especially in time of Warre.
    </p>
<p>
      Of Authors there be two sorts. The first simply so called; which I have
      before defined to be him, that owneth the Action of another simply. The
      second is he, that owneth an Action, or Covenant of another conditionally;
      that is to say, he undertaketh to do it, if the other doth it not, at, or
      before a certain time. And these Authors conditionall, are generally
      called SURETYES, in Latine Fidejussores, and Sponsores; and particularly
      for Debt, Praedes; and for Appearance before a Judge, or Magistrate,
      Vades.
